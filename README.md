# 'Ckeditor Spell Check'  

Dev-Edge Repository.
 
Ckeditor is constantly evolving - and we need to move with that wave.

This repo exists for users of Nanospell's spellchecker plugin for Ckeditor to contribute ideas and code.  It provides a centralised location to share different forks of the spellchecker without senidng js files by email.

The first action is to allow Alex Tsai an opertunity to share and explore improved UI performance by tighter integration with the CKeditor core - moving away from DOM traversal and modification as a means to apply and remove spellchecking style spans.  So thanks for this Alex, its a great idea.

I hope that a move to put more of our code on github, even if not free-licensed is a postive step in the right direction for transparency and stability.

 

Happy coding, and thanks for you great ideas and contributions.
